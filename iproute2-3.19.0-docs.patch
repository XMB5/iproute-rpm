Subject: [PATCH 1/7] docs: improve manual pages and help
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Commit 43d29f7 substantially improves generated ip-address.8 instead of
ip-address.8.in and commit e419f2d removes the generated one losing the
improvements entirely. This commit recovers the lost changes, adapts
them to the current manual page and adds more man page and help
improvements.

Based on previous work by:

 * Kenyon Ralph <kenyon@kenyonralph.com>

ip link:

 * Add VLAN documentation.
 * Fix srcport/dstport in VXLAN documentation.

ip address:

 * Improve manual page synopsis and built-it help.
 * Use full subcommand names (e.g. 'address' and 'maddress').
 * Specify when IPv4, IPv6 or both are affected.
 * Add lifetimes, home and nodad.
 * Reduce left over double spaces.

ip route:

 * Prefer 'show' over 'list' for consistency.

ip rule:

 * Remove false statement about Rule 0.

ip tunnel:

 * Improve manual page synopsis and built-it help.

ifcfg:

 * Add manual page.

bridge fdb:

 * Fix fdb synopsis.

tc qdisc:

 * Add cbq manual page alias.

Changes (ss):

 * Turn Debian specific statement into a general one.
 * Refer to .ps docs instead of .html.

+.SH DESCRIPTION
+This manual page documents briefly the
+.B ifcfg
+command.
+.PP
+This is a simplistic script replacing one option of 
+.B ifconfig
+, namely, IP address management. It not only adds
+addresses, but also carries out Duplicate Address Detection RFC-DHCP,
+sends unsolicited ARP to update the caches of other hosts sharing
+the interface, adds some control routes and restarts Router Discovery
+when it is necessary.
+
+I strongly recommend using it 
+.RI instead
+of
